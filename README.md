# work_to_catch_up
This work is based on Pytorch.

First, for a new training it will require a dataset, the necessary scripts are uploaded in work_to_catch_up/Dataset.

The work here used top88.py to generate input data, and the ground truths were generated by top88_AM.py. Once the npy files created, simply follow 
the steps of pre-processing to create a dataset of paired images.

Once the dataset is prepared, then to clone the documents on https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix(environment.yml)
To run the training, it has to install the virtual environment first
For training the normal model, simply run the train.py file in the github link above, the model with Feature Controller only replaced the original 
networks with networks_with_FC in "models" folder.
To use the trained model for inference, run the files in "Script_Use_Pretrained_Model" folder. The script named "mian_inference_for_Volume_without_FC"
is for the prediction of Volume Fraction only, and the script named "mian_inference_for_AR_VF_with_FC" is for the prediction generated by the novel
model with feature controller. The scripts can also give the information of the trainable parameters.
